description: Comprehensive React code quality review for best practices, TypeScript, performance, accessibility, and testing
---

Perform a comprehensive code quality review of React/TypeScript code against the CODE_STANDARDS.md guidelines.

This review combines automated analysis with AI-powered code inspection to ensure React best practices, TypeScript quality, performance optimization, accessibility compliance, and testing standards.

## Step 1: Determine Review Scope

**Ask the user to specify:**

1. **Review Scope:**
   - Entire project (all files in src/)
   - Specific feature (e.g., src/features/user/)
   - Specific files (provide file paths)

2. **Focus Areas** (select all or specific):
   - All (comprehensive review)
   - React patterns (components, hooks, composition)
   - TypeScript quality (strict mode, no any, proper typing)
   - Performance (memo, useMemo, useCallback, lazy loading)
   - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
   - Testing (coverage, quality, user-centric tests)
   - Tailwind CSS usage
   - File organization and naming
   - Security and dependencies

## Step 2: Review Workflow

### 1. React Best Practices

**Check for:**

✅ **Functional Components:**
- All components are functional (no class components)
- Named exports used (no default exports)
- Proper prop interface definitions

❌ **Anti-patterns:**
- Class components
- Default exports
- Components without TypeScript props interfaces

**Check for:**

✅ **Hooks Rules:**
- Hooks only called at top level (not in conditions/loops)
- Custom hooks named with `use` prefix
- Proper dependency arrays in useEffect/useMemo/useCallback
- No missing dependencies

❌ **Anti-patterns:**
- Conditional hooks
- Hooks in loops
- Missing or incorrect dependencies
- Effects without cleanup where needed

**Check for:**

✅ **Component Composition:**
- Composition over inheritance
- Props use children, header, footer patterns
- Proper use of React.ReactNode for children

❌ **Anti-patterns:**
- Class inheritance
- Prop drilling (should use context)
- Tightly coupled components

**Check for:**

✅ **Error Boundaries:**
- Features wrapped with error boundaries
- Proper error fallback components
- Error logging implemented

**Check for:**

✅ **Keys in Lists:**
- Stable, unique keys (using IDs)
- No index as key (unless list is static)

### 2. TypeScript Quality

**Check for:**

✅ **Strict Mode Compliance:**
- tsconfig.json has `strict: true`
- All strict flags enabled (noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks, etc.)

❌ **Type Safety Issues:**
- `any` types used (should use `unknown` with type guards)
- Unsafe type assertions (as Type without validation)
- Missing prop interfaces
- Implicit any in function parameters

**Check for:**

✅ **Proper Type Definitions:**
- Named exports for interfaces
- Discriminated unions for variants
- Utility types (Partial, Omit, Pick) used appropriately
- Type guards for runtime validation

**Check for:**

✅ **Type Guards:**
- Runtime type checking with `is` predicates
- Validation before type assertions
- Proper narrowing of unknown types

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Check for:**

✅ **React.memo Usage:**
- Expensive components are memoized
- Custom comparison functions where needed
- Proper memo usage (not over-memoization)

❌ **Performance Issues:**
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Missing memoization on expensive computations
- Inline function/object creation in render

**Check for:**

✅ **useMemo:**
- Used for expensive computations
- Proper dependency arrays
- Not overused for simple operations

**Check for:**

✅ **useCallback:**
- Used for callbacks passed to memoized children
- Proper dependency arrays
- Used with event handlers in optimized components

**Check for:**

✅ **Code Splitting:**
- Routes lazy loaded
- Heavy components lazy loaded
- Proper Suspense boundaries with fallbacks

**Check for:**

✅ **Virtual Scrolling:**
- Used for large lists (>100 items)
- Proper implementation with react-virtual or similar

**Check for:**

✅ **Bundle Size:**
- No large unnecessary dependencies
- Tree-shaking enabled
- Proper imports (named imports from large libraries)

### 4. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Check for:**

✅ **Semantic HTML:**
- Proper use of header, nav, main, article, section, footer
- No div-soup (divs used only when no semantic alternative)
- Heading hierarchy (h1-h6 in order)

❌ **Accessibility Issues:**
- Divs used instead of semantic elements
- Missing or incorrect heading hierarchy
- Non-semantic markup

**Check for:**

✅ **ARIA Usage:**
- ARIA used only when HTML semantics insufficient
- Proper aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby
- Correct ARIA roles
- aria-expanded, aria-controls for interactive elements

❌ **ARIA Anti-patterns:**
- ARIA used when HTML semantics exist (e.g., role="button" on div)
- Missing labels on interactive elements
- Incorrect ARIA attributes

**Check for:**

✅ **Keyboard Navigation:**
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Proper onKeyDown handlers (Enter, Space)
- Focus management (modals, dialogs)
- Focus traps in modals

❌ **Keyboard Issues:**
- Interactive elements not keyboard accessible
- Missing keyboard handlers
- Poor focus management
- Keyboard traps

**Check for:**

✅ **Focus Indicators:**
- Visible focus indicators (focus-visible)
- Sufficient contrast (2px outline minimum)
- Custom focus styles when default removed

❌ **Focus Issues:**
- outline: none without replacement
- Invisible or low-contrast focus indicators

**Check for:**

✅ **Color Contrast:**

### 5. Testing Quality

**Check for:**

✅ **User-Centric Tests:**
- Tests use React Testing Library
- Query by role, label, text (not testId)
- Test user behavior, not implementation
- Proper use of userEvent

❌ **Testing Anti-patterns:**
- Testing implementation details
- Using getByTestId as primary query
- Testing internal state
- Snapshot tests without purpose

**Check for:**

✅ **Accessibility Tests:**
- jest-axe integrated
- Automated accessibility tests on components
- No violations in tests

**Check for:**

✅ **Test Coverage:**

### 7. File Organization

**Check for:**

✅ **Feature Structure:**
- Files organized in src/features/[feature-name]/
- Proper subdirectories: components/, hooks/, context/, services/, types/, utils/
- Each file has corresponding .test file
- Storybook files (.stories.tsx) for components

**Check for:**

✅ **Public API Pattern:**
- Each feature has index.ts with named exports
- Imports use feature's public API (not internal paths)

❌ **Organization Issues:**
- Deep imports into feature internals
- Missing index.ts files
- Scattered test files

### 8. Naming Conventions

**Check for:**

✅ **File Naming:**
- Components: PascalCase.tsx
- Hooks: camelCase.ts with `use` prefix

## Important Notes

- **Be specific**: Include file paths (absolute), line numbers, and code snippets
- **Be constructive**: Explain why something is an issue and how to fix it
- **Be practical**: Prioritize high-impact issues over nitpicks
- **Be educational**: Reference CODE_STANDARDS.md sections for learning
- **Be thorough**: Check all aspects of the selected focus areas
- **Be honest**: If something is done well, acknowledge it

Focus on code quality and user experience, not just syntax. The goal is to help developers write better React applications that are maintainable, accessible, performant, and well-tested.
